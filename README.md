# Containerized ETL Pipeline with Prefect and PostgreSQL
A minimal, containerized ETL pipeline scaffold using Prefect for orchestration and PostgreSQL for local storage. Itâ€™s designed to be easy to spin up with Docker, easy to extend with your own flows, and simple to test locally with Poetry/pytest.

Tech stack:
- Python (managed with Poetry)
- Prefect (orchestration & scheduling)
- PostgreSQL (local persistent store)
- Docker & Docker Compose (runtime)
- Pytest (tests)
- GitHub Actions (CI hooks under .github/workflows/)

Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local runs without Docker)
- Poetry (pipx install poetry or see poetry docs)
